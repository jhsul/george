GEORGE - _Gompei's Eternal hub for Online Reports, Grades, Et cetera_ - is a recreation of [OSCAR](https://oscar.wpi.edu/), a tool for browsing WPI student course reports. OSCAR is powerful and widely used, but it lacks real analytics and the site is kind of shit to navigate. GEORGE has an informative and accessible UI, as well as additional analytics and viewing options.

This repository also includes a [jupyter notebook](/analysis/george.ipynb) containing a more in-depth explatory analysis of the course report data.

**GEORGE exists because WPI students' access to course report data should not be limited in any way by a professor.**
